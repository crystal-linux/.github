# How to get your RFC passed
To approve an RFC, 51%+ of the current Core Team members must vote in favor of the final RFC text. 
A vote can be initiated at any time, but if the group determines that more changes are needed, then it can be postponed.
If there should be an even number of team members, and the vote is split, then the current project lead is permitted to vote again to decide the outcome.
