### By-Laws

Each of the documents linked above defines **Responsibilities**, **Powers** and rules regarding **Appointment/Dismissal** of each role.

These are considered finalized, however, amendments can be made as follows:

#### Amending the By-Laws

By-Laws can be amended through two possible processes:

- An RFC can be opened, regarding the change of one or more parts of the By-Laws.

  This would constitute a **Major vote**.

- Under exceptional circumstances, the Project Lead can act reasonably to remedy the situation, as well as request for the **Core Team** to amend the by-laws so that they cover the situation in the future.
    
  This constitutes part of the **Project Lead**s power to veto certain actions.

Once the amendment is decided on and enacted, it is important to **ensure that an RFC is opened**, so that changes to the By-Laws over time are tracked.

### Finances

Finances are managed on OpenCollective by the Open Source Collective fiscal host. Internally, however, a new expense (or the removal of a stale one) must be opened as an RFC.

This constitutes a **Major vote**.

### Glossary

- **Major vote**:
  
  A vote requiring at least 75%+ consensus to enact. The relevant By-Laws cover which person(s) may be able to veto a vote or break a tie.

- **Minor vote**:

  A vote requiring at least 51%+ consensus to enact. The relevant By-Laws cover which person(s) may be able to veto a vote or break a tie.

- **RFC**:

  Request for comment. A special kind of proposal that affects either the Project as a whole or greatly affects any subset of the project. 

  Submitted as an issue template on the `crystal-linux/.github` repository, these can constitute either **Major vote** or a **Minor vote**, whichever is fit for the current context.

- **Veto**:

  The power to unilaterally (without possible objection) deny a decision. Should not be used lightly.
